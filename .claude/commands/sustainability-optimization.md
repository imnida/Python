Assess a workload's environmental sustainability posture against the Well-Architected Sustainability pillar, identifying opportunities to reduce carbon footprint through resource efficiency, managed services, and architectural optimization.

## Step 1: Gather context

Ask the user:

> What workload would you like me to assess for sustainability? Please share:
> - **Architecture overview** (compute, storage, database, networking services)
> - **Utilization patterns** (average CPU/memory utilization, traffic patterns, idle periods)
> - **Region selection rationale** (proximity to users, compliance, or legacy?)
> - **Sustainability goals** (optional — organizational carbon targets, reporting requirements)

If context is already provided, proceed directly.

## Step 2: Assess resource utilization

Evaluate how effectively provisioned resources are used:
- **Compute utilization** — Average CPU and memory usage across instances/containers. Are instances idle during off-hours?
- **Storage efficiency** — Are old/unused objects retained? Are lifecycle policies in place? Is storage class appropriate for access frequency?
- **Database utilization** — Is provisioned capacity matched to actual demand? Are there idle read replicas?
- **Network efficiency** — Are data transfers minimized? Are endpoints co-located where possible?
- **Over-provisioning** — Are resources sized for peak when demand is variable?

## Step 3: Evaluate architecture efficiency

Assess:
- **Serverless adoption** — Could provisioned compute be replaced with Lambda, Fargate, or Aurora Serverless to scale to zero?
- **Managed services** — Are there self-managed workloads (Kafka, Elasticsearch, Redis) that could use managed equivalents with better utilization?
- **Graviton adoption** — Are ARM-based instances used where supported? (better performance per watt)
- **Async patterns** — Are synchronous processes that could be event-driven identified? (reduces idle waiting)
- **Batch optimization** — Are batch jobs scheduled during low-carbon grid periods? Are they right-sized?

## Step 4: Assess data management practices

Evaluate:
- **Data lifecycle** — Are retention policies defined and enforced? Is cold data moved to Glacier/Deep Archive?
- **Data deduplication** — Is redundant data storage eliminated?
- **Compression** — Are stored and transferred payloads compressed?
- **Tiered storage** — Is Intelligent-Tiering used for unpredictable access patterns?
- **Data proximity** — Is data stored close to where it's processed?

## Step 5: Evaluate scaling and scheduling

Assess:
- **Scale-to-zero** — Can non-production environments shut down outside business hours?
- **Scheduled scaling** — Are predictable low-traffic periods handled with reduced capacity?
- **Right-sizing cadence** — How often are instance types and sizes reviewed?
- **Spot Instances** — Are fault-tolerant workloads using Spot for better resource pooling?
- **Region-aware scheduling** — Are flexible workloads routed to regions with lower carbon intensity?

## Step 6: Assess software and code efficiency

Evaluate:
- **Algorithmic efficiency** — Are there known inefficient algorithms or unnecessary computation?
- **Caching** — Does caching reduce redundant computation and data retrieval?
- **Payload optimization** — Are API responses, assets, and transfers minimized?
- **Framework efficiency** — Are lightweight runtimes used where possible?
- **Client impact** — Is downstream device energy considered? (page weight, client-side computation)

## Step 7: Produce findings

Output:
