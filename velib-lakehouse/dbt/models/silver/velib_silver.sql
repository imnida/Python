-- Model       : velib_silver
-- Description : Cleans and enriches raw Vélib snapshots from the Bronze layer.
--               Filters out ghost stations (NULL stationcode, zero capacity).
--               Computes bikes_delta and depletion_rate_per_minute using LAG
--               window function partitioned by station_code.
